**Project README: Detecting Anomalies in Airplane Customer Reviews**

**Objective**

This project aims to identify anomalies in airplane customer reviews, specifically instances where the expressed sentiment is positive, 
but the given rating is unexpectedly low. This discrepancy suggests potential issues that require further investigation.

**Methodology**

Gather a comprehensive dataset of airline customer reviews, including text content and associated ratings (e.g., 1-5 stars).
Clean and preprocess the text data:
Handle missing values
Sentiment Analysis Model Training
Optimize hyperparameters
Use the trained sentiment analysis model to predict the sentiment polarity of each review in the dataset.
Develop a model to quantify the discrepancy between predicted sentiment and the actual rating.
Define thresholds for real rating-sentiment model rating discrepancy
Evaluate the performance of both the sentiment analysis model and the discrepancy model using appropriate metrics
Technologies

**Expected Outcomes**

A high-performing custom sentiment analysis model tailored to the specific characteristics of airline customer reviews.
A robust and accurate model for detecting anomalies in airline customer reviews.
A framework for ongoing monitoring and analysis of customer feedback to identify potential service quality issues.
